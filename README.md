Random UK train trip planner

Setup

1. Untar /cache/untar_me.tar - this contains cached copies of lat/lon for settlements and stations. The API can generate these too but this will save you some API calls
2. Enter your API key and App ID from the TransportAPI in index.php - get these from https://developer.transportapi.com/
3. Check file permissions on /cache/ directory for writing
